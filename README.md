What is Magnesium Sulphate Feed Grade?
Magnesium Sulphate (MgSOâ‚„) is a highly soluble and bioavailable source of magnesium and sulfur, two essential nutrients for livestock. It is commonly used as a dietary supplement in animal feed to prevent deficiencies and improve metabolic functions.
Key Benefits of Magnesium Sulphate Feed Grade

Enhances Bone DevelopmentMagnesium, along with calcium and phosphorus, plays a key role in bone formation, promoting skeletal strength and reducing the risk of bone deformities.
Improves Digestive HealthSulfur aids in digestion by contributing to enzyme activation and gut microbiome balance, improving nutrient absorption.
Boosts Milk Production in Dairy CattleAdequate magnesium intake enhances milk yield and quality in dairy cows, making it an essential component in their diet.
Prevents Magnesium Deficiency (Hypomagnesemia)Magnesium deficiency can lead to grass tetany in cattle and sheep, causing weakness, seizures, and even death. Supplementing with Magnesium Sulphate helps mitigate this risk.
